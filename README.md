# Neo4j GraphRAG Advanced for Grinning Cat

Bring graph-aware memory retrieval to your Grinning Cat instance.

**Neo4j GraphRAG Advanced** is a plugin that replaces the standard vector-only memory layer with a hybrid GraphRAG pipeline powered by **Neo4j** and **spaCy**. It stores memories as documents, extracts entities and relations into a knowledge graph, and combines **vector similarity**, **direct entity matches**, and **graph expansion** to retrieve more relevant context.

If your Cat needs to remember not only *similar text* but also *who*, *what*, *where*, and *how things are connected*, this plugin is built for that.

---

## Why this plugin exists

Traditional vector search is great at semantic similarity, but it can miss documents that are topically relevant when the same concept is expressed with different wording.

This plugin improves recall by adding a graph layer on top of embeddings:

- documents are stored in Neo4j
- entities are extracted from each memory
- relationships are created between entities
- retrieval combines semantic search with graph-aware expansion

The result is a memory system that can better answer queries involving:

- people, organizations, products, dates, and locations
- technical stacks and domain keywords
- connections between concepts across multiple memories
- multi-hop knowledge that would be hard to recover with vectors alone

---

## What it does

### Core features

- **Native Neo4j vector search** for document embeddings
- **Entity extraction with spaCy** during ingestion
- **Technology keyword detection** with regex patterns for tools and frameworks
- **Knowledge graph construction** with `Entity`, `Document`, and `Collection` nodes
- **Semantic relationship extraction** between entities
- **Hybrid recall pipeline**:
  - direct entity match from the user query
  - related-entity graph traversal
  - vector similarity search
  - score merging and reranking
- **Collection-aware storage** for Grinning Cat memories
- **Tenant isolation** using the Cat agent identifier
- **Cross-document entity reuse** so knowledge persists across multiple memories

### Retrieval strategy at a glance

When Grinning Cat searches memory, the plugin can:

1. capture the raw user message before recall starts
2. extract entities from the query
3. find documents that directly mention those entities
4. traverse related entities in the graph up to a configurable depth
5. run standard vector search in parallel
6. merge and rerank all candidates into a final result list

This makes retrieval both **semantic** and **topically grounded**.

---

## How it integrates with Grinning Cat

This repository is a plugin for **Grinning Cat** and depends on the `base_plugin` package.

At runtime it provides:

- a custom vector database handler: `GraphRAGHandler`
- a settings model: `Neo4jGraphRAGConfig`
- a hook in `main.py` that captures the raw user message before memory recall

That hook is important: it allows the retrieval stage to extract entities from the actual query text, instead of relying only on whatever vector search returns.

---

## Architecture overview

### Ingestion

When a memory is added:

1. the document is saved in Neo4j with its embedding
2. the document is linked to a collection
3. entity extraction runs in the background
4. extracted entities are deduplicated and merged across documents
5. `MENTIONS` edges are created from documents to entities
6. `RELATED_TO`-style edges are created between entities
7. `SIMILAR_TO` document relationships are generated from vector similarity

### Retrieval

The recall pipeline combines three signals:

- **Direct entity recall**: documents mentioning the same entities found in the query
- **Related entity recall**: documents linked through entity relationships in the graph
- **Vector recall**: standard semantic nearest-neighbor search on document embeddings

Results found by both graph and vector phases receive a boost during reranking.

---

## Requirements

Before using this plugin, make sure you have:

- a working **Grinning Cat** installation
- the `base_plugin` dependency available in your Cat environment
- a running **Neo4j** instance
- a Neo4j version with **vector index support** available
- Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- at least one installed **spaCy model**

### Python dependencies

From this repository:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install a spaCy model

The default configuration uses `en_core_web_lg`.

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
```

If the configured model is unavailable, the extractor attempts to fall back to `en_core_web_sm`.

---

## Installation

Add this plugin to your Grinning Cat plugins environment, then ensure the Python dependencies and spaCy model are installed.

A typical setup is carried out by using the [Admin UI](https://github.com/matteocacciola/grinning-cat-admin), or by
using the proper endpoint exposed by the Grinning Cat API.

## Custom technology patterns

Besides spaCy NER, the plugin also uses regex patterns to catch technology names that NER models often miss.

Built-in patterns already cover terms such as:

- Neo4j
- MongoDB
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Python
- TypeScript
- LangChain
- spaCy
- RAG / GraphRAG / LLM / GPT
- AWS / Azure / GCP

You can extend this list with `extra_technology_patterns`, for example:

```python
[
    r"\\b(MyFramework|MyTool|InternalPlatform)\\b",
    r"\\b(CatOps|KnowledgeMesh)\\b",
]
```

This is especially useful for:

- internal project names
- domain-specific technologies
- non-English technical vocabulary
- branded tools that spaCy may not recognize reliably

---

## Data model

The graph is centered around a few core concepts:

- **`Collection`**: a logical memory collection for a Cat tenant
- **`Document`**: a stored memory chunk with content, metadata, and embedding
- **`Entity`**: a normalized concept extracted from documents

Main relationships:

- **`BELONGS_TO`**: document → collection
- **`MENTIONS`**: document → entity
- **`RELATED_TO`**: entity ↔ entity semantic relation
- **`SIMILAR_TO`**: document ↔ document similarity relation

Entities are hashed using tenant ID, entity type, and normalized name so they can be reused across multiple documents.

---

## Entity and relation extraction

The extraction pipeline supports:

- standard spaCy named entities
- technology detection via regex
- entity deduplication by normalized name
- relation extraction from dependency parsing
- fallback relation inference from local text proximity
- optional co-occurrence links for small entity sets

Supported entity categories include:

- `PERSON`
- `ORGANIZATION`
- `TECHNOLOGY`
- `CONCEPT`
- `LOCATION`
- `DATE`
- `PRODUCT`
- `EVENT`
- `FINANCIAL`
- `UNKNOWN`

---

## Notes on collections and deletion

Collections are isolated by tenant and collection name.

When a collection is deleted:

- its collection node is removed
- its documents are deleted
- orphaned entities are pruned only if they are no longer mentioned anywhere else

This preserves shared knowledge across collections whenever entities are still referenced.

---

## Operational notes

### Embedding dimension must match

The plugin validates that the running embedder size matches the configured Neo4j vector index dimension.

If you change embedding model size, you may need to recreate the collection or rebuild indexes.

### Neo4j is treated as a remote database

This handler is designed for a remote database backend and uses the Neo4j async driver.

### Background tasks are used during ingestion

Entity extraction and similarity-link creation are scheduled asynchronously when new memories are added.

---

## Limitations and practical considerations

A few things are worth knowing before production use:

- the plugin is optimized for **graph-aware recall**, not as a general-purpose graph management UI
- vector indexes must be compatible with the embedding dimension produced by your Cat embedder
- spaCy model quality strongly affects entity extraction quality
- relation extraction is heuristic by nature and may need tuning for specialized domains
- enabling entity embeddings increases storage usage
- large memory imports may create many background extraction tasks
- the `save_dump` method is not implemented; Neo4j-native backup tools should be used instead
- hybrid collections are currently not supported

## Known Limitations

The following limitations are known and accepted for the current release. They do not affect correctness in normal use, 
but are worth understanding before deploying at scale or in specialized domains.

### 1. Ingestion performance: sequential Neo4j round-trips per document

Entity extraction runs in the background after each document is stored. For each document, the handler issues one Neo4j
query per extracted entity and one per extracted relation. A document yielding 20 entities and 15 relations generates
roughly 55 sequential database calls.

This does not block the user response (all extraction is scheduled with `asyncio.create_task`), but it can slow down
bulk ingestion. A future improvement will batch this writes using `UNWIND`-based queries.

### 2. `SIMILAR_TO` relationships are directional

Document-to-document similarity links are stored as directed relationships:

```
(a:Document)-[:SIMILAR_TO]->(b:Document)
```

Similarity is inherently symmetric, but the current graph only records one direction per pair. The active retrieval
pipeline does not traverse `SIMILAR_TO` edges directly, so this has no impact on recall quality today. Any future
extension that performs graph traversal over similarity links should use an undirected pattern (`-[:SIMILAR_TO]-`)
to avoid missing half the graph.

### 3. Technology pattern list is English-centric

The built-in `TECHNOLOGY_PATTERNS` list targets English proper nouns (framework names, cloud providers, programming
languages). It will miss technology terms written in other scripts or domain-specific jargon outside the list.

The `extra_technology_patterns` setting is available to extend the list at configuration time. For non-English or
highly specialized knowledge bases, this field should be populated accordingly.

### 4. `enable_entity_embeddings` does not yet drive retrieval

When `enable_entity_embeddings` is set to `True`, the plugin creates a vector index on entity nodes and stores an
embedding on each entity. However, the current retrieval pipeline (`_recall_entity_direct`, `_recall_entity_related`)
uses graph traversal exclusively and does not query the entity vector index.

The flag is forward-looking: it anticipates a future retrieval phase where the user query embedding is matched against
entity embeddings directly, adding a fourth signal to the hybrid pipeline. Until that phase is implemented, enabling
this option increases storage usage without improving recall.

---

## Final note

If your Grinning Cat should reason over memories like a connected knowledge space instead of a flat vector pile, this
plugin gives it sharper recall, richer context, and a more structured memory backbone.
